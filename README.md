# TavernTales
A D&D-inspired game attempting to capture some of the feeling of a real live D&D campaign. It will include different types of Dungeon Masters (DMs), from fantastical tales where the heroes are never in any real danger, to tales of woe and peril as your party faces insurmountable challenges.

Proof of concept. Probably will never get finished.
